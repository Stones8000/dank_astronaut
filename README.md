# Dank Astronaut
Dank Astronaut is a Discord bot custom coded for the [Dank Moon](https://discord.gg/dPgEcaE4TM) guild!
## Features
### DM New Members
Whenever a new member joins the server, they get a nice embed sent to their DMs to show them around the server!
### Verification
The bot has a message in the verification channel in the server which has a button members click to gain the "Verified" role, letting them access the rest of the channels. Upon verifying, the bot will also send them a welcoming message in space-chat, however this message is deleted after a couple of minutes to prevent spam of the channel.
